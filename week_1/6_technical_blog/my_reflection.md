Blog url: yohanyi.github.io/index.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

Learning from my previous experience from my solo challenge, I planned most of the things out from the beginning. I wanted to keep it simple, but not too plain. I decided I would simply make a header for the title, and a content section for the actual blogging I would be doing. I haven't recieved any feedback yet, but I am going to encourage my cohort to give me some constructive criticism. I want to get better and learn more. I feel confident in designing and creating layouts, but sometimes, I get confused on how to move things around. I definitely want to learn how to use classes and id much better to improve my skills.
