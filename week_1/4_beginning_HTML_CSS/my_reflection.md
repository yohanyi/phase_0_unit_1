I regret not spending too much time on HTML/CSS during the prep. period. Not only did I spend not a lot of time, the last time I touched HTML/CSS was a few months ago. After some review, it started to come back to me, moreso the HTML than the CSS. HTML and CSS are pretty straight forward and was pretty easy to catch up. HTML and CSS are pretty straight forward and pretty easy to understand after a few minutes of reading and studying. For me the only "bad" about HTML/CSS is that I feel like they were slightly boring compared to programming in Ruby or JS. I didn't have any "aha" moments but I'm glad we reviewed HTML/CSS because I might have forgot all of it if I waited any longer!
