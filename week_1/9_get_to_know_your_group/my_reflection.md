Sup everyone! Finally glad to meet you all! 

A little about my self:

My name is Yohan Yi and I'm from Los Angeles, CA!
Some of my favorite websites are geekologie.com, bleacherreport.com, grantland.com, and many more! (also a youtube addict)
My thinking style is Abstract Random and my VARK learning style is multimodal (aural and kinesthetic).

I'm also very new to programming and would love any feedback or advice that you guys/girls can offer me!

Please, e-mail me to set up any pair dates and times! Any weekday is fine with me as long as I know ahead of time! 

Nice to meet you all, and have fun during your DBC journey.

----------------------------------------------

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

The fireside chat really got me settle down and really enjoy the moment isntead of worrying so much. I went through other people's response about their fears and expectations helped me settle down. Some were complete novice's like me, which made me feel that we were on the same team, and some were more experienced, which I felt would definitely help our team move forward faster and stronger. This week has truly been a blessing. For my learning experience, and just knowing that I'm capable and that I'm not alone really put me at ease. The fact that everyone here is motivated and willing to help and work as a team, makes me more confident and motivated. I can't waite for the real experience to begin. On a final though, is it just me or does it feel like after phase 0 I'll bee a different person/programmer?
