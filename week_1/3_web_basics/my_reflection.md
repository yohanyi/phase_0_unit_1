I learned that websites can be found with by using the IP address instead of their domain names. DNS works as the yellowpages (phonebook) of the internet. 
Few things remember when setting up your HTML site is make sure you have the right tags for your HTML code. Also, make sure you have a clear purpose for your web page and choose the proper host.
That was actually my first real web page that I've ever built! It was pretty exciting to know how much more there is to learn and what I can achieve once I've learned those things. One of the things that became more clear for me was the interaction of files using git and github.
