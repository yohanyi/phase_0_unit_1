I want to start by saying, HTML/CSS was something that I sort of neglected during the prep. period. I had done the CodeAcademy track for HTML/CSS a few months ago, and pretty much forgot a huge chunk of it until my recent attempts at the solo challenge. Everything was a learning experience, from working with git, figuring out how I should layout my HTML/CSS, and how to organize my webpage. My first attempt was a mess, but after hours of reading, learning, and tinkering, I can say I'm actually proud of what I learned in the given period of time. I would say the hardest part was simply getting the CSS to work properly. Reading and learning about the "box model" really helped me to understand positioning items in html/css. The most tedious part was tinkering with the CSS to get it exactly how I like, then cleaning the code up. I found that I had a lot of repeated attributes. I feel like the most important thing I learned was that preparation is necessary. I'm not going to lie, I tried going through the challenge on the fly and it did NOT turn out well. Planning the layout, size, and themes will save you a lot of time and headaches. On a scale of 1-10 on confidence in the Learning Competencies, I feel like I'm at a 7. I'm confident, but I feel like I still have many flaws and a bunch of more learning to do.
