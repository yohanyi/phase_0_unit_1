Creating a repository is easy on GitHub and cloning it to your local computer is just as easy. All you have to do is click on the button "new repository", give your repo a title, and make sure you have the correct liscense to open source your project. After creating a repository on GitHub, you must remember that the repository is not ready for use directly from your computer because GitHub is a remote repository, therefore you would want to make sure you create a clone of the repo in your local computer. 
I think open source is a great idea that is really one of the driving factors that creates software that keeps on moving forward. The ability to open source your project, and in return allows you to help with other people's projects is an amazing feature. Open source does not make me feel nervous or protective because there are different liscense that allow different things. Liscense is what allows others to help software grow, change, and become better than they were before. This section helped me better to understand why liscenses are used, and why sometimes they are NOT used.
