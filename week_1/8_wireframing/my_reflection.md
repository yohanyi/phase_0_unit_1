Even before I saw this, I found out how important design was to the process during the solo challenge. I think it's an important aspect of developing and I definitely had fun learning about it. The hardest part was finding the correct tool to wireframe. I didn't want to draw it out, so I used one of the tools that was mentioned in the reading. I learned not to dwell on what goes where, but to take a general grasp of what you waht and start working from there. 
I had trouble finding the exact layout for some tabs and images, so I would just use a general "rectangle" and type over them and labeling them. I enjoyed "reverse engineering" our sites we blogged about. I actually felt like I can give them some advice to clean their pages up, or to make it more user friendly and visually appealling. I feel like I learned a LOT, but still have so much more to learn. Although I didn't get to color coordinating my wireframe, I feel like that part would be the most difficult.
