## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

Setting up git and Github was not technically difficult and had no real struggles with it. There were a few moments where I was not sure if I was setting things up correctly. I had set up git and Github through some of the tutorials in the prep period and understood the general concepts of git and Github. I learned that I need to become more comfortablea nd familiar with using the terminal/command lines.

Git is simply software that allows the user to track and save all changes made to files. Git lives locally in your computer, which means to view, add, or track changes made to a file, you would need access to the computer it lives on. GitHub is where you can add those same files that are living only on your computer into an online hub where other people can access your files. This way people don't need access to your physical computer to view or add changes to your files. 

Version control helps track any changes made to a file. Version control allows a user to see all different changes made to a certain file, and when you made those changes. Not only does version control track a files "life", but it allowed multiple people to make changes to a file, while the actual file does not get tampered with. This is possible by creating a "branch" off the master file. Github give developers the platform to share their code with other developers, and to help other developers by accessing other's codes while not making any permanent changes to the master file!

It makes perfect sense that developers use version control. Git allows a developer see all the different changes made to a set of code, and even allows them to see when and who made those changes. This can make it much easier to understand why changes were made. I believe this allows developers to be creative in developing software because, with version control such as git, no changes are permanent and gives the developer the safety net to be creative.
