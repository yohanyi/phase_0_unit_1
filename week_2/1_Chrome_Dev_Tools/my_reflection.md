DOM is a interface that allows you to create update web pages dynamically. I don't know if this is the correct analogy, but I just feel like DOM allows elements in a web page to be treated as objects. This allows you to easily manipulate elements in a webpage to become dynamic. I want to see more examples of how this is used, and how it is beneficial. I'm sure we'll learn more of DOM in our js phase. The good is definitely the easy access and how easily you can manipulate your website, but I feel at the same time it can create lazy designers. This is because you can go out there and just copy a lot of peoples design.
I chose to look a photo blog made with wordpress, and I notice the amount of scripts in the html file and the length of their CSS files. This shows that a lot of work is done with the details in making a site look good. I found chrome web tools very fun, but the tutorial was kind of buggy and I had a hard time. I think its really cool how you can directly access and change webpages.
