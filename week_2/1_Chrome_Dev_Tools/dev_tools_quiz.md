##QUIZ
* Explain which tabs support the following actions and how.
  * Realtime editing of HTML and CSS 
  * Javascript Debugging
  * Performance Optimization 

To do realtime editing of HTML and CSS, you have to go to the "ELEMENTS". The elements tab allows to quicly few the all the html elements on the web page, and also directly links you to which CSS sheet the element is linked too.

Javascript Debugging is done in the "Sources" tab. This tab shows you where your errors are, and it tells you what the error is. This makes it much easier to find why some interactive applications are not working correctly.

Performance Optimization can be done on the "Timeline" tab. This tab shows you how long each file takes to download and load onto your browser. You can use googles PageSpeed app. for advice on how to speed up your websites loading times. You could also speed up loadtimes by combining js files into one, and removing white space.


* What's the quick key for your OS to spawn the Dev Tools inspector?

For my chrome developer tool, the quick key is CMD+ALT+I.

* Go to http://www.postmachina.com/ and analyze and tweak this nicely designed page.
  * What is the current background color for the page?  (Surprisingly, it's not just black!)
  * Tweak the background color to white.
  * Tweak the height of the side bar that contains the logo.  Shrink it down to 85px.
  * Roll over the navigation links.  When you hover over them, they dissapear.  Let's change the hover color to black instead.
  * Now take a screenshot of your new (and maybe not so improved) design.  It should match this screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/5ak1jkpl5/
  * Upload your own image to the imgs directory in the `1_Chrome_Dev_Tools` directory.  It should match the image above. The last nav link in the image above is black because the mouse was hovering there when the screenshot was taken. Do the same, and don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. (This is part of the challenge.)

* For the postmachina website, why can't you tweak the color of the text "The most important things are not things"?  Please explain.

I believe it's because it is not actually text, it is an image.

* Go to www.ticketswizard.com and analyze the page.  
  * What is the largest image on the website? 
  * Explain how you would find out this information, and list the URL of offending image here and how big it is.

  I went to the network tab on my developer tool, refreshed my page and ordered my list from largest to smallest. This was the largest image. The image was 316KB.

* Test the www.ticketswizard.com website with google's [PageSpeed Insights](http://www.ticketswizard.com/).  (You can also download the chrome plugin).  What is the easiest thing to change to optimize the website?  How many kilobytes of data can be eliminated?
 
 I feel the easiest thing to do is optimize the images. Not only will it save you 885.9KB (39% reduction), pagespeed gives you a optimized version link for all the images.
