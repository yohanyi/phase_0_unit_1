# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I think web standards are very important and good in general. It probably makes it easier for peopel to learn, and gives a general sense of what to expect based off of web standards. The standard structure does make sense because it's very straight forward. Honestly, I'm not too comfortoble with the new HTML5 elements. I don't know if that's because that isn't how I first learned it and because I'm very new to html/css. I understand that HTML5 is becoming more semantic by trying to replace the standard divs, but I feel that even with a lot of divs, html code is not hard to read at all. Reset.css is needed because some portions of html have their own style such as the bullet points, and blue underlined links. Reset really gives you a true plain html to work from. I do notice changes in sites visuals when on different browsers. I think it's bad and annoying that they do. I still feel that I need to read more about the outlining in HTML5, because it was a little confusing. I plan to delve deeper into phase 0 topics when I have the time to really sit back and go through everything.
