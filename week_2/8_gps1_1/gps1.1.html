                <img src="http://griid.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/titanic-sinking.jpg" align="left"> Hi friends, my name's Irene. I'm a 23 year old front-end developer from Brooklyn, NY. In my spare time,
                you can find me doing yoga, reading mystery novels, and watching great movies. Here are some of my favorite
                movies:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Titanic</li>
                        <li>Disney movies</li>
                        <li>Every movie that's not a horror flick</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                <br><br>
                This was my first GPS session and it was fantastic. I think it's great having someone coding with you because it really
                helps with creativity and not making as many mistakes. Yohan was a great partner and communicates really, really
                well. Definitely looking forward to my next pairing session.

                Hi everyone, my name is Yohan Yi and I am currently residing in Los Angeles, CA. I'm an aspiring web developer
                plan to further my learning at DBC San Francisco. I love playing golf, basketball, and watching lakers games.
                Here is a small list of a few of my favorite movies:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Matrix</li>
                        <li>The Usual Suspects</li>
                        <li>Old School</li>
                    </ul>
            </p>
            
            <br><br>
            My first GPS was session was really good. I felt my partner was very knowledgeable and I definitely
            learned a few tricks on styling webpages. Irene and I did a very good job of planning and executing
            and we I felt like we had good balance throughout our pairing sessions. I asked a lot of questions
            and Irene was more than happy to help. I hope all my pairing partners are just as awesome!
