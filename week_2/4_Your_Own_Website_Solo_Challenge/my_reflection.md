My Website url: http://yohanyi.github.io

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

During my solo challenge, I learned the importance of design and user experience. I enjoyed my time designing and thinking about u/x while I was designing. I think wireframing really helped me to plan ahead and keep me focused on how I wanted things to turn out. I'm more of a experimental person, so I would usually just code out the html and freestyle the CSS until I got it to look how I wanted. With the wireframing and planning, I was able to be very specific in what I wanted to do, and what I needed help with. I learned how to fix a tab across the screen so you don't have to scroll back up to look for it. I thought CSS was just blind coding, as in you jus type in what you want, but realized how important to plan things out especially when using many divs, classes, and id's. You have to understand how certain how all the layers react with eachother. My main source of help came from http://w3schools.com and http://css-tricks.com. Both sites really helped with syntax.
