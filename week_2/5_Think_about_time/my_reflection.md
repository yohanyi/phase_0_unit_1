# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

The biggest time management challenge I have with phase 0 is planning ahead, learning everything I need, and making sure I dont fall behind. With work and other priorities in life, it is definitely not easy to find the time to delve into all the phase 0 material as deep as I would like. Sometimes, all I have time for is do some reading and attempt the challenges. 
One of my major problems is that I don't plan. I don't plan on how long things will take, what I want to finish, what I need to finish or my approach to the problems. I just go through the material one by one, not planning anything. I don't have a schedule that I work at and just do some phase 0 work when time opens up.

One of the techniques I definitely want to try is Fogg's 3 steps to changing behavior. I found his talk very inciteful, and  feel like I would greatly benefit from creating habits to increase my productivity.  I also plan to practice creating a work "flow" by increasing my concentration. 

My overall plan for phase 0 is to finish all requirements, while gaining a healthy understanding of creating work flow, planning ahead, and understanding the material. I want to start planning on a weekly basis, and as the days go by plan on what I would like to finish the next day. I want to start changing small habits such as rewarding myself for finishing certain tasks, and really changing my menstal approach to work. My definitely want to change my approach to work and life, to help me become more productive and increase my focus.
