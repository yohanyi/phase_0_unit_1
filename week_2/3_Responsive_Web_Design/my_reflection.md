* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Responsive web design, is a design principle that lets you fluidly transition your webpage into different browsers and devices of multiple screen resolutions. I think it's a great practice, because more and more people are using their phones to do a lot of their webpage surfing, so you have to create a responsive website to allow them to view your page with ease. Web design was primarily designed to allow people to view the website on a computer monitor. Even now, computer monitors come in all sorts of sizes, and can tremendously affect your website design. As computer screens allow higher resolutions, webpages will become much more aesthetically pleasing. 
Visually impared people use the web through sound. I do believe we definitely should take sometime to allow visually impaired people to surf the web. 
Honestly, I don't understand why there are so many different ways to do the same simple things. I understand that as websites become much more complex, that you might need certain syntax for your website to behave exactly the way you want it.
